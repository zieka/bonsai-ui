<hr/>

Large component libraries and UI frameworks tend to offer a lot of tools to aid in rapid prototyping and then expect developers to cut out the excess. Bonsai's approach is to start on the opposite end of the spectrum.

Bonsai UI focuses on keeping things simple by starting small.

If building sites with simple, clean, and lightweight interfaces is your goal, Bonsai may be for you.
